# OrangeHRM Automation Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the QA Bootcamp **Automation Testing Project**.  
Our goal is to apply the full software testing process using **Selenium, Java, and TestNG** while following the **Scrum methodology**.

We selected the **OrangeHRM Demo Application** as our system under test (SUT).  
The project simulates a real QA working environment, where the team collaborates to plan, design, implement, and present automation workflows.

  - Create a Traceability Matrix
  - Design positive and negative test cases for the chosen workflows

- **Day 3 – Implementation**
  - Set up the Java Maven project
  - Configure Selenium and TestNG
  - Start automation coding

- **Day 4 – Implementation**
  - Continue automation coding
  - Generate TestNG reports

- **Day 5 – Presentation**
